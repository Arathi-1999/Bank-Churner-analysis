# Bank-Churner-analysis
This repository contain SQL file of Bank Churners.

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze the data and predict who is going to get churned so that we can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customer's decisions in the opposite direction.

# Key Takeaway:
1) The number of customers attriting in the age range of '40-50' years is the highest followed by 50-60 years.

2) The difference in the average of male and female amongst the existing and attriting customers has almost no difference at all and all hovers around the 46 years mark.

3) The number of "Female" are higher amongst both the attrited and existing customers.

4) The possibility of a "Female" customer attriting is higher than that of a 'Male" customer.

5) Those number of customers who are "Doctorate" and "Post-Graduate" have a very high attrition rate as comapred to existing customers.

6) The number of customers who had left the bank is the highest for the customers whose marital status is "Married".
